                This is an in-progress website to demonstrate what projects I have worked on, or am currently
                working
                on. This includes my coursework at Iowa State University, as well any personal projects. The idea is
                to
                eventually have seperate pages for each project, potentially with my thoughts on development.
            <ol>Work in Progress:

                <li>Figure out how to imbed python code</li>
                <li>Put CS127 projects on website</li>
                <li>Figure out how to imbed java code</li>
                <li>Put CS227 and CS228 projects on website</li>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Andrew Butler, and I am a current student of Computer Science at Iowa State University.
                As of writing, I am in my fourth semester of studies, and am currently working on learning machine
                language, algorithms (runtime analysis, how to make them better, etc), and web development. Having grown
                up around them, I love computers and technolgy, and what can be done with them. I am an Iowa native and
                a big Chicago Cubs fan. While I would consider myself a gamer, I am not super great at any FPS games or
                anything like that; I mostly play Halo and Forza casually.
