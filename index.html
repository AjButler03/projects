                This is an in-progress website to demonstrate what projects I have worked on, or am currently
                working
                on. This includes my coursework at Iowa State University, as well any personal projects. The idea is
                to
                eventually have separate pages for each project, potentially with my thoughts on development.
                <br>

                For now, this is going to be on hold, primarily due to me not really enjoying developing webpages.
            <ol>Work in Progress:

                <li>Figure out how to imbed python code</li>
                <li>Put CS127 projects on website</li>
                <li>Figure out how to imbed java code</li>
                <li>Put CS227 and CS228 projects on website</li>

            <p>
                My name is Andrew Butler, and I am a current student at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, majoring in computer science. I love computers and technology, and what can be done with them. I enjoy problem solving, and I think that coding presents a good opportunity to blend the two. I am an Iowa native and a big Chicago Cubs fan. While I would consider myself a gamer, I don't set asside the time to play nearly as much as I used to; my favorite games are Halo, Forza, and Fallout.
